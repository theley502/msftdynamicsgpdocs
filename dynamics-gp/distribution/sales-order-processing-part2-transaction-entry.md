# Sales Order Processing Part 2: Transaction entry

This part of the sales order processing documentation explains how to enter sales documents and sales batches. The data entry windows were designed to resemble actual sales documents, with customer, line item, tax, and total information. The following topics are discussed:

- *Chapter 7, “Item information,”* describes item tracking and pricing related to Sales Order Processing.

- *Chapter 8, “Multicurrency transactions,”* explains the multicurrency features in Sales Order Processing.

- *Chapter 9, “Batches,”* explains how to use batches to group sales documents for transferring or posting.

- *Chapter 10, “Quotes,”* explains how to enter quotes—including repeating quotes.

- *Chapter 11, “Orders,”* explains how to enter orders—including repeating orders.

- *Chapter 12, “Fulfillment orders and invoices,”* explains how to enter fulfillment orders,

- *Chapter 13, “Invoices,”* explains how to enter invoices.

- *Chapter 14, “Back orders,”* explains how to enter back orders.

- *Chapter 15, “Returns,”* explains how to enter returns and how to use return quantity types.

- *Chapter 16, “Transaction detail entry,”* describes how to enter detailed information about a document, customer, line item, or other element of a transaction.

- *Chapter 17, “Payments and deposits,”* contains information on entering payments or deposits received for a document.

- *Chapter 18, “Sales Order Processing taxes,”* explains how sales tax is calculated, modified, and distributed in Sales Order Processing.

## Chapter 7: Item information

Use this information to learn more about handling items in Sales Order Processing. This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Drop-ship transactions*

- *Standard pricing calculations*

- *Extended pricing calculations*

- *Unit cost*

- *Multiple bins overview*

- *Non-inventoried items*

- *Adding items*

- *Serial- or lot-numbered items*

- *Kit items*

- *Assigning instruction IDs to customer and item records*

- *Available to promise overview*

### Drop-ship transactions

Drop-ship transactions are for items that are shipped from your vendor directly to the customer. The item isn’t received into or sold from your inventory.

- To mark all line items on a sales document as drop-ship, choose Options \>\> Drop Ship Item in the Sales Transaction Entry window before entering items. When this option is marked, items on the sales document will be marked as drop-ship as they are entered.

- To mark an individual line item as drop-ship, mark the drop-ship box next to the item number in the Sales Transaction Entry window or the Sales Item Detail Entry window. Kit items can’t be drop-shipped.

> [!NOTE]
> To change the shipping address for a single line item, choose the Ship to Address ID lookup button in the Sales Transaction Entry window or the Sales Item Detail Entry window and select a new ship-to address ID. The changes will apply only to the selected line item. If you enter a new line item, the ship-to address ID will come from the previously entered item.

You can’t enter a return in Sales Order Processing for a drop-ship item. If a customer returns an item, enter a credit memo in Receivables Management to reduce the customer balance and a credit memo in Payables Management to reduce the balance you owe the vendor.

You can create a purchase order in Purchase Order Processing automatically for drop-ship items on an order or back order. There are options in the Sales Order Processing Setup window for combining items on a drop ship order based on the ship-to address. For more information about creating a purchase order, see *Chapter 21, “New purchase orders.”* For more information about drop ship setup options, see *Chapter 2, “Module setup.”*

### Standard pricing calculations

If you’re using standard pricing and entering an inventoried item in the Sales Transaction Entry window, the unit price*—*the price at which each item is being sold—will be calculated using the information entered for the item in the Item Price List Maintenance window.

The price for an item is determined by price levels. The system will first check the price level selected on the customer card. If a price level hasn’t been assigned to the customer, the price level from the Receivables Management Setup window is used. If there isn’t a price level set up for the customer or for Receivables Management, the default price level for the item is used.

When you enter an item, the price from the item price list is determined by the price level and the unit of measure selected on the sales document for the item. If a price hasn’t been set up for the price level, the default price level for the item will be used to determine the price. You can view the price level used for the item in the Sales Item Detail Entry window.

Depending on how Sales Order Processing is set up, you may be able to change the unit price on the document or enter a unit price that is below cost. For more information, see *Chapter 2, “Module setup.”*

For information on selecting and activating a pricing method, see *Selecting a pricing method* and *Enabling extended pricing*. You can also find more information in the Inventory Control documentation.

### Extended pricing calculations

If you are using extended pricing, when you create an order or other sales transaction for a customer, the following process is used to select the price for each item on the transaction. First, the system searches for item-specific pricing information, beginning in price sheets assigned directly to the customer (which must be active and include the current date), followed by price sheets in the price book assigned to the customer, and then the base price book.

If no item-specific pricing is found, the system searches for a price group that includes the item, beginning in price sheets assigned directly to the customer, followed by price sheets in the customer’s price book, and finally the base price book.

If an adjusted value-off or percent-of-list price is found, the rest of the pricing structure is searched for a list price to apply the discount to. For example, if there’s a value-off price in a price sheet assigned to the customer, the customer’s price book and the base price book are searched for a list price.

It is possible for the final price to be the result of two adjustments applied to the base price. For example, a customer sheet might give 2% off the customer price book price, which is itself 5% off the base price. If multiple promotions are applied, they are applied in the order they are discovered: first the promotions from the first step of the search, then from the second step, and so on.

For information on selecting and activating a pricing method, see *Selecting a pricing method* and *Enabling extended pricing*. For more information on setting up and using extended pricing, see the Inventory Control documentation.

### Unit cost

If Sales Order Processing was set up to display unit costs, the unit cost will be displayed in the Sales Transaction Entry window for each sales inventory type item. The unit cost will not be displayed for items that are assigned the type of service, flat fee, or miscellaneous charge.

The unit cost is the current cost or the standard cost of the item, depending on the inventory valuation method. The following table shows the default cost that appears as the Unit Cost for each valuation method.

| **Valuation method** | **Unit cost displayed** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| FIFO perpetual       | Current cost            |
| LIFO perpetual       | Current cost            |
| Average perpetual    | Current cost            |
| FIFO periodic        | Standard cost           |
| LIFO periodic        | Standard cost           |

The cost displayed might not be the cost used to adjust inventory and cost of goods sold when the document is posted; this will depend on the valuation method used.

| **Valuation method** | **Unit cost used in posting**         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| FIFO perpetual       | Actual cost based on valuation method |
| LIFO perpetual       | Actual cost based on valuation method |
| Average perpetual    | Current cost                          |
| FIFO periodic        | Standard cost                         |
| LIFO periodic        | Standard cost                         |

For the Average Perpetual valuation method, the current cost represents the average cost of the item and is updated whenever the item quantity is increased.

If you enter a return, the default entry for the unit cost of a line item is the current cost for the item from the Item Maintenance window. If returns are set up to allow overriding item cost, you can change the unit cost of the item, which is the cost used to return the item to inventory.

### Multiple bins overview

Use multiple bins to add another level of detail to item quantity tracking. Besides tracking items within inventory sites, with multiple bins you can track item quantities in bins at each site. Bin quantities are processed and displayed in the item’s base unit of measure.

> [!NOTE]
> You can set up bin information when multiple bins functionality has been installed and registered. However, you must also enable this feature in Inventory Control before you can use bins to track items. For more information on enabling multiple bins, see the Inventory Control documentation.

Default bins for transaction types at each site can be identified for use in transactions. For example, a default bin could be created for sales order transactions at your warehouse site. Default bins can also be identified for a particular item and transaction type at a site. For example, if you always use Bin A when selling a certain item from your main site, you can set up Bin A as the default sales order bin for the item at the main site. Microsoft Dynamics GP automatically creates item-sitebin relationships the first time a bin is used for a transaction.

When you enter a transaction, the default bin for the transaction type at the itemsite or the site is used automatically. If there isn’t a default bin at the item-site or at the site, you will be required to enter a bin. If the site’s default bin is used, an item-site-bin record is created automatically. If you delete the line or document after the item-site-bin record is automatically created, that item-site-bin relationship is not deleted.

If serial or lot numbers are assigned to an item on a transaction, the bins for the selected serial or lot numbers will be assigned to the transaction automatically.

For more information on setting up and using multiple bins, see the Inventory Control documentation.

### Non-inventoried items

You can set up Sales Order Processing to allow entering items that don’t exist in your inventory records.

When you enter a non-inventoried item you must enter the item description, unit price, and unit cost. The item won’t be tracked in inventory, but it will appear on Sales Order Processing analysis and history reports.

The following default accounts are used for non-inventoried items.

| **Account**                               | **Source**    |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Inventory                                 | The account assigned to non-inventoried items for the Sales series in the Posting Account Setup window.|
| Returned, In Use, In Service, and Damaged | The account assigned to non-inventoried items for the Sales series in the Posting Account Setup window. |
| Cost of Goods Sold                        | The account assigned to the customer, if you are using posting accounts from the customer.   |
| Sales                                     | The account assigned to the customer, if you are using posting accounts from the customer.  |
| Accounts Receivable                       | The customer card. If no account is assigned to the customer, the system uses the account from the Sales series in the Posting Account Setup window. |
| Markdown                                  | The Inventory series in the Posting Account Setup window.   |

The account from the Inventory series in the Posting Account Setup window, if you are not using posting accounts from the customer.

The account from the Inventory series in the Posting Account Setup window, if you are not using posting accounts from the customer.

### Adding items

If you enter an item number that doesn’t exist in inventory, you can select Options \>\> Add Item in the Sales Transaction Entry window to be prompted to either add the item to your inventory or to choose a different item. Selecting Add Item can help prevent data entry errors that inadvertently create non-inventoried items. You will be able to use this option only if Sales Order Processing is set up to allow entering non-inventoried items.

If you select Add Item and you enter an item that isn’t in your inventory, a message will be displayed and you’ll have the option to add the item. If you choose Add in the message window, the Item Maintenance window will open and you can enter the item information. Choose Cancel in the message window to delete the item number and enter a different one.

Add Item will remain marked as long as the Sales Transaction Entry window is open. If you close the window and open it again, you must select Add Item again.

### Serial- or lot-numbered items

If an item is tracked by serial or lot numbers, you must identify the specific item or items being sold, and you must assign the serial or lot number before you ship the item.

Serial and lot numbers may be automatically assigned to items, depending on how Sales Order Processing is configured. The serial or lot number will be assigned according to the item’s valuation method.

If Sales Order Processing is not set up to automatically assign serial and lot numbers to items, you can enter or select a serial or lot number. When the item is fulfilled, the Sales Serial Number Entry window or the Sales Lot Number Entry window will open and you can assign the serial or lot number to the item. If your system is set up to automatically assign lot numbers, a message won’t be displayed if the expiration date for the lot number has expired.

If you’re using multiple bins and serial or lot numbers are assigned to an item on a transaction, the bins for the selected serial or lot numbers will be assigned to the transaction automatically.

If you add a serial- or lot-numbered item to a return document, the Sales Serial Number Entry or Sales Lot Number Entry window will open and you can enter the serial or lot number for the item.

> [!NOTE]
> Don’t override shortages on serial- and lot-numbered items. Your inventory will be overstated when the quantity is replenished.

You can view or change the serial or lot numbers that are assigned to an item. For more information, see *Changing a serial or lot number*. You can also view or change the bins that are assigned to an item. For more information, see *Changing bins in Sales Order Processing*.

### Kit items

Kit items aren’t tracked in inventory; their components are. If you’re using multiple bins, a kit’s component items are assigned to bins, but the kit item itself is not. When a kit is allocated, the quantity available in inventory for each component item is checked for shortages.

Kits are treated differently from other items in Sales Order Processing. You can’t partially transfer kits from one document to another. For example, if you add a kit item to an order, you must transfer the entire quantity for the kit item to either an invoice or a back order. Also, you can’t drop-ship a kit item.

The distribution accounts for kits come from several different sources and are summarized in the following table.

| **Account type**         | **Posting account from**                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Receivables              | Customer                                                      |
| Sales                    | Kit or customer, depending on Sales Order Processing setup    |
| Commission expense       | Posting Account Setup for Sales                               |
| Commission payable       | Posting Account Setup for Sales                               |
| Inventory                | Kit component or customer, depending on Sales Order Processing setup          |
| Return types (In Use, In Service, Damaged, and  Returned) | Kit component or customer, depending on Sales Order Processing setup|
| Cost of goods sold       | Kit component, kit item or customer, depending on Sales Order Processing setup |

### Assigning instruction IDs to customer and item records

If you’re using advanced picking, use the Instruction ID Processing window to select the customer/address/item combination or the customer/item combination to assign an instruction ID to.

Use the Picking Instruction Preview window to assign the instruction ID to the records that match the selected combinations. For more information about instruction IDs, refer to *Setting up picking instruction IDs*.

#### To assign instruction IDs to customer and item records

1. Open the Instruction ID Processing window.
    (Sales \>\> Cards \>\> Process Instructions)

    ![Screenshot that shows the Instruction ID Processing window.](media/SOage064.jpg)

2. Enter or select an instruction ID.

3. To assign the instruction ID to a customer record or an item record, select Assign. To remove the instruction ID from a customer record or an item record, select Remove.

4. Enter or select a customer ID or range of customer IDs.

5. You can enter or select additional options to display records for, such as customer addresses, item numbers, item class IDs, and generic descriptions of items.

    For example, suppose you have 40 different types of paint brushes in inventory and some of the paint brushes have a generic description of Watercolor Brush. To assign a specific instruction ID to all brushes that have a generic description of Watercolor Brush, select From in the Generic Description field and enter or select Watercolor Brush in the From and To fields.

6. Choose Preview to open the Picking Instruction Preview window and view the records that match your restrictions.

    ![Screenshot that shows the Picking Instruction Preview window.](media/SOage065.jpg)

    Unmark records that shouldn’t be assigned to the instruction ID or choose Unmark All.

7. Choose Process to assign the selected instruction ID to the marked item records.

8. Close the window.

### Available to promise overview

Available to promise (ATP) means that an item is in stock and can be promised to a customer. You can see how much inventory or projected inventory is not committed to customer orders and is available. ATP is calculated for an item from the latest document date to the earliest document date for all supply orders, including sales orders, sales fulfillment orders/invoices, purchase orders, inventory transactions, inventory adjustments, inventory transfers, assembly transactions, and manufacturing orders.

To determine the item quantities available to promise, you must consider both the actual demand of the item and meeting that demand as efficiently as possible.

For example, if an order is entered for February 15, 2006, it would be most efficient to fulfill that commitment from supply expected to be replenished as near to February 15, 2006 as possible.

By knowing how much of each product you have on hand and how much is committed to customer orders, you can better control your inventory. You also can give customers a firm promise of when a product is deliverable by viewing existing commitments and eliminating the risk of overselling a product.

You can use the Inventory Available to Promise Inquiry window to view available to promise information for an item.

## Chapter 8: Multicurrency transactions

If you’re using Multicurrency Management with Sales Order Processing, you can choose the currency you want to enter on quotes, orders, fulfillment orders, invoices, back orders, and returns.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Viewing multiple currencies for sales transactions*

- *Exchange rate and document date*

- *Multicurrency account distributions*

- *Sales Order Processing amounts*

### Viewing multiple currencies for sales transactions

You can choose whether you want to view multicurrency transactions in the originating or the functional currency. Choose View \>\> Currency \>\> Functional or Originating while entering a quote, order, fulfillment order, invoice, back order, or return. The option will be saved on a per user, per window basis.

The Options menu and Currency list button are available in the Sales Transaction Entry window. You also can use the Currency list button in other windows that support changing the currency view.

The first time you open these windows, all the transactions will be displayed in the originating currency. If you change the currency view, the option you last used will be the default view the next time you open that window.

### Exchange rate and document date

If a transaction’s currency ID is not in the functional currency, the rate type and associated exchange rate table assigned to the selected customer are assigned to the transaction. If a rate type isn’t assigned to the customer, the default rate type for the Sales series specified in the Multicurrency Setup window is used.

The document date assigned to a transaction determines which exchange rate is used, based on the currency ID and associated rate type that’s entered for the transaction. Each time you change the document date on a multicurrency transaction, the system searches for a valid exchange rate. If a valid rate doesn’t exist, you can use the currency expansion button to enter an exchange rate using the Exchange Rate Entry window. You also can use the Exchange Rate Entry window to view or modify the default exchange rate. If you’ve entered a General Ledger posting date that’s different from the document date, the exchange rate expiration date must be after the posting date.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose a currency ID for the transaction that is not your functional currency and have the view set to functional, functional amounts entered might change slightly. This is because the system calculates the originating value of the functional amount and then recalculates the functional equivalent of the originating amount. This is done so that the originating amounts will total correctly.

### Multicurrency account distributions

For multicurrency transactions, distribution amounts are displayed in both the functional and originating currencies. However, you can change only the originating amounts.

When you’re entering a multicurrency transaction, the originating debit and credit amounts must balance. If the functional equivalents don’t balance, the difference is posted automatically to a Rounding Difference account and a distribution type of Round identifies the distribution amount in the Sales Distribution Entry window.

For example, assume you’ve entered an invoice in the euro currency, with a sale amount of 30,886.59 EUR, a trade discount of 586.84 EUR, a discount available of 1544.33 EUR and the exchange rate is 1.0922. The distributions would be calculated as follows:

| **Account**               | **Euro debit** | **Euro credit** | **US dollars debit** | **US dollars credit** |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Accounts Receivable       | 28,755.42 EUR  |                 | \$31,406.67          |                       |
| Trade Discount            | 586.84 EUR     |                 | \$640.95             |                       |
| Discount Available        | 1544.33 EUR    |                 | \$1686.72            |                       |
| Sales                     |                | 30,886.59 EUR   |                      | \$33,734.33           |
| Totals                    | 30,886.59 EUR  | 30,886.59 EUR   | \$33,734.34          | \$33,734.33           |
| Rounding Difference       |                |                 |                      | \$0.01                |
| Totals                    | 30,886.59 EUR  | 30,886.59 EUR   | \$33,734.34          | \$33,734.34           |

### Sales Order Processing amounts

All amounts on a multicurrency Sales Order Processing document are calculated in the originating and functional currencies. If you change an exchange rate, the originating amounts are assumed to be correct and the functional amounts will be recalculated using the new rate. The amounts are calculated as follows:

- **Subtotal** The subtotal is calculated automatically by adding the extended prices in the originating currency for items. The subtotal in the originating currency is then converted to the functional amount. Thus, the subtotal in the originating currency will always equal the sum of the extended prices, but the subtotal in the functional currency might not equal the sum of the items’ extended price in the functional currency.

- **Taxes** Taxes are calculated in the originating currency and then converted into the functional currency. The tax details are updated only in the functional currency.

- **Amount Received** If you receive a deposit or payment, the amount can be entered in the originating or functional currency. The exchange rate used for the deposit or payment must be the same rate used for the document.

- **Commissions** Commissions are calculated using originating amounts, then converted to functional amounts.

- **Distributions** The distribution accounts must be assigned to the originating currency before the transaction can be posted in General Ledger. You can post the transaction in Sales Order Processing but it won’t be posted in General Ledger until the account is assigned to the currency.

- **Multidimensional Analysis (MDA)** If a transaction includes analysis information, it is updated only in the functional currency. If the functional amounts are recalculated, the MDA amounts will be recalculated and any changes made to MDA accounts will be lost.

- **Rounding** When converting amounts from one currency to another, there is the possibility of rounding differences. Rounding adjustments are posted in the functional currency and are posted to the rounding account specified for the originating currency. The account can be changed but the rounding amount can’t be changed.

### Chapter 9: Batches

Batches are groups of transactions with something in common that are identified by a unique name or a number. For example, batches can be a group of transactions entered by a specific employee, or they can be a group of transactions entered on a particular date.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Creating a batch*

- *Modifying a batch • Deleting a batch*

### Creating a batch

Use the Sales Batch Entry window to create a batch. You must save quotes, orders, and back orders to a batch.

#### To create a batch

1. Open the Sales Batch Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Batches)

    ![Screenshot that shows the Sales Batch Entry window.](media/SOage068.jpg)

2. Enter a batch ID, such as your name or the date, to identify the batch.

3. Select the batch origin of Sales Transaction Entry and enter a batch comment, such as a brief description of the transactions that will be entered in the batch.

4. Enter or accept the posting date. This field will be available only if your system is set up to use the batch date for posting. If this field is unavailable, the posting date from the Sales Date Entry window for each transaction will be the posting date for each transaction.

    The date you enter is the date the General Ledger records will use. Sales Order Processing records will be updated according to the document date entered in the Sales Transaction Entry window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The General Ledger posting date only applies to invoices and returns because those are the only document types that are posted.

    For more information about posting settings, see the System Setup instructions (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting Up the System).

5. Select the Checkbook ID that will be affected by the transactions in this batch.

6. If your system uses batch verification, enter the required number of transactions that must be entered before this batch can be posted.

7. If your system uses batch verification, enter the required currency amount for all transactions you’ll enter in this batch.

8. Choose Save.

9. When you have entered all your transactions in a batch, you can choose File \>\> Print or the printer icon button to print an edit list or batch list to verify your entries.

    - **Edit list** Contains the transactions that can be posted—invoices and returns.

    - **Batch list** Contains all the transactions saved in the batch, including quotes, orders, back orders, invoices, and returns.

### Modifying a batch

Use the Sales Batch Entry window to make changes to an unposted batch. Transactions can be added only to batches that have an Available or Unapproved status; you can’t add transactions to batches that have been approved for posting.

#### To modify a batch

1. Open the Sales Batch Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Batches)

2. Enter or select a batch ID. If you enter the batch ID, you must also select the origin.

3. Make your corrections and choose Save.

### Deleting a batch

Use the Sales Batch Entry window to delete an unposted batch of sales documents. You can’t delete batches that have been approved for posting.

If a batch contains documents that can’t be deleted, these documents will remain in the batch. Documents that can’t be deleted are:

- Documents that have been printed (except for quotes)

- Documents that contain partially transferred items

- Documents that contain a posted deposit

- Documents that contain line items linked to saved purchase orders

- Quotes that have been submitted to sales quote workflow

- Orders, fulfillment orders, and invoices that haven’t been submitted to customer credit limit override workflow

- Orders, fulfillment orders, and invoices that have been submitted to customer credit limit override workflow

#### To delete a batch

1. Open the Sales Batch Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Batches)

2. Enter or select the batch ID you want to delete. If you enter the batch ID, you must also select the origin.

3. Choose Delete.

## Chapter 10: Quotes

Quotes are valuable sales tools because customers or potential customers might request estimates—or quotes—for the cost of items before they make purchase decisions. You can include items from inventory on a quote, as well as items that aren’t tracked in inventory, such as installation, labor, and mileage. Your cost and the price to the customer will be calculated automatically.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Prospect customers*

- *Entering a prospect record*

- *Sales quote approval workflow*

- *Entering a quote*

- *Entering a repeating quote*

### Prospect customers

Prospect customers are potential customers that you maintain records for, but don’t add to your customer base. To enter prospects, you must set up the quote ID to allow prospects. Only quotes can be entered for prospect customers.

To transfer a quote for a prospect customer to an order or to an invoice, you must add the prospect to your customer base or assign the prospect to an existing customer. The Prospect To Customer window opens when transferring a quote to an invoice or order so you can transfer a prospect record to a customer record. You can use the prospect information to create a customer record in the Customer Maintenance window. If you add the prospect as a customer, the prospect record won’t be deleted automatically. You must delete it in the Sales Prospect Maintenance window.

For information about creating prospect customer records, see *Entering a prospect record*.

### Entering a prospect record

### Sales quote approval workflow

Your company can use the sales quote workflow feature as part of its business controls. If you use this feature, you can define how quotes have to be approved before transferring the quotes to invoices or orders. The rules for approving quotes can be defined to fit your organization's needs.

When a quote is ready to be approved, approvers can be notified and the quotes can be approved, using Outlook, Dynamics GP, or SharePoint. After a quote completes the Workflow process, it can be printed, sent in e-mail, or transferred to an order or invoice.

To transfer a quote for a prospect customer to an order or to an invoice, you must add the prospect to your customer base or assign the prospect to an existing customer.

## Chapter 13: Invoices

Because sales invoices are legally binding documents that record the prices and details of transactions, they should be posted. The cost of goods sold and the price for the customer will be calculated automatically. If items on an invoice can’t be filled from inventory, you can transfer the invoice items to a back order.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Understanding invoices*

- *Entering an invoice*

### Understanding invoices

You can use the Sales Transaction Entry window to enter, print, and send invoices in e-mail to your customers and to view, void, post, delete, or transfer existing invoices.

You also can create an invoice by transferring a quote, order, or back order to an invoice. When you transfer a document to an invoice, information about the document, customer, and items will be transferred to the invoice.

If you’re using sales fulfillment workflow, an invoice is created from a fulfillment order when you advance the document status to status six. Refer to *Understanding fulfillment orders* and *Entering a fulfillment order or invoice*.

Transaction amounts on an invoice will be distributed automatically to posting accounts. The distribution accounts and amounts won’t be displayed for Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold. The actual cost will be determined when you post the invoice and the cost and distribution accounts will be displayed on the posting journal. To verify the accounts that will be used for each item, choose the Item Number expansion button to open the Sales Item Detail Entry window. Choose Distribution to view or change the accounts used for that item.

You can enter a negative invoice quantity for a line item, but the negative quantity won’t be allocated or fulfilled. The negative invoice quantity is assigned the return quantity type of On Hand automatically. You can’t enter a negative invoice quantity for a drop-ship line item.

If you’re using Multicurrency Management, you can change the distribution amounts only in the originating currency. If you change an amount in the originating currency, the functional amount will be recalculated.

### Entering an invoice

## Chapter 15: Returns

Return documents record the return of items you previously sold. Returns decrease the customer’s balance on account and may increase inventory quantities. Because returns record an increase to inventory and a refund of sales, they should be posted.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Return quantity types*

- *Entering a return*

### Return quantity types

When a customer returns an item, you must enter the returned item into one or more return quantity types. Quantity types are used to track whether an item is ready for resale or whether it is damaged, being serviced, or in use.

The return quantity types are On Hand, Returned, In Use, In Service, and Damaged. If you enter a return that increases more than one quantity type, separate purchase receipts are created to record the increase for each quantity type. For example, suppose a customer returns five telephones. Three need service before you can resell them and the other two are damaged and can’t be repaired. In this case, you’d return three to the In Service quantity type and two to Damaged. Two purchase receipts are created to track the information. For more information about purchase receipts, see the Inventory Control documentation.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you return an item to a return quantity type other than On Hand, you can’t resell the item. You must transfer the item to On Hand before it can be sold again. If the item was returned to the Damaged quantity type and you want to return the item to the vendor, you must transfer the item to On Hand and then enter a decrease adjustment for the item.

If you’re using multiple bins, you must enter a bin quantity and select a bin for each quantity type you enter. For example, if the quantity returned is 10 and you entered 8 with a quantity type of On Hand, and 2 with a quantity type of Damaged, two bin selection records are created: one for 8 on hand at the sales returns default bin, and one for 2 damaged at the sales returns default bin. For serial- and lot-tracked items, you can change bins or split the line’s extended quantity among two or more bins for each site and quantity type.

If you enter a kit item on a return document, the Sales Returned Quantities Entry window will open and you can enter the amount returned for a quantity type. You can’t return a kit to multiple return quantity types. For example, suppose a customer returns two kits. When you enter the item in the Sales Transaction Entry window with a quantity returned of 2, the Sales Returned Quantity Entry window opens. You must return the entire quantity to one quantity type. You can’t return one kit to On Hand and the other to Damaged.

You can use the Sales Kit Return Options window to change the component information for the returned kit. You can add or delete components from the kit, change the site that a component will be returned to and change the extended kit quantity of a component.

If you change the extended kit quantity for a component, the Sales Returned Quantities Entry window will open and you can enter the quantity and quantity type for the component. You can choose a quantity type for the component that is different from the type chosen for the kit. You can also return the component to more than one quantity type. You can open the Sales Kit Return Options window from the Sales Transaction Entry window by highlighting the kit item, then choosing the item expansion button to open the Sales Item Detail Entry window. In that window, choose Kits to open the Sales Kit Return Options window.

### Entering a return

You can use the Sales Transaction Entry window to enter and print returns for your customers and to view, void, post, or delete existing returns.

You can’t enter a return in Sales Order Processing for a drop-ship item. If a customer returns a drop-ship item, enter a credit memo in Receivables Management to reduce the customer balance and a credit memo in Payables Management to reduce the balance you owe the vendor.

If you enter a serial-numbered or lot-numbered item on the return document, the Sales Serial Number Entry window or the Sales Lot Number Entry window will open and you can enter the serial or lot numbers for the items being returned.

If you’re using multiple bins and a default sales returns bin exists at either the itemsite or the site, the quantity at the default bin will increase by the extended quantity for an item not tracked by serial or lot numbers. You can edit the default bin selections. For serial- and lot-numbered items, the default sales returns bin is the default bin for the first serial or lot number you enter. If a default sales returns bin can’t be found, you will be required to create one.

Transaction amounts on a return will be distributed automatically to posting accounts. To verify the accounts that will be used for each item, select the item expansion button to open the Sales Item Detail Entry window. Choose Distribution to view or change the accounts used for that item.

If you’re using Multicurrency Management, you can only change the distribution amounts in the originating currency. If you change an amount in the originating currency, the functional amount will be recalculated.

12. Taxes for the return will be calculated automatically as you enter items.

13. Enter the amount received and the discount returned on the document.

    The amount received is treated as a return of cash or credit to the customer. The Sales Payment Entry window will open and you can enter information about the payment, such as the payment method. The payment amount will be posted when you post the return.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enter an amount received on the return, a voucher or check for the customer won’t be created automatically. You need to process the amount returned as a separate transaction in Payables Management if a computer-generated check is needed.

14. If you’ve entered payment terms for this customer and a payment was made at the time of the sale, enter the terms discount related to the payment.

    Use the Discount Returned expansion button to open the Sales Payment Terms Entry window, where you can view or change the terms discount dates and amounts for the document.

You can change the unit cost in the Sales Transaction Entry window if the return ID is set up to allow overriding item costs.

    > [!Note]

### Merging trade discounts and markdowns with sales distributions

If Microsoft Dynamics GP is set up to merge trade discount and markdown distributions, the trade discount and markdown distributions will be merged with the sales distribution for invoices and returns. If a quote, order, or back order with a deposit is transferred to an invoice, the trade discount and markdown distributions will be merged with the sales distributions.

For example, assume that you’ve entered a sales transaction of \$100.00 with a trade discount of \$15.00 and a markdown of \$10.00. If Dynamics GP is set up to merge trade discount and markdown distributions, the distributions are merged as in the following example.

| **Account**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Account A SALES |           | \$75       |
| Account D RECV  | \$75      |            |

If Dynamics GP is not set up to merge trade discount and markdown distributions, the distributions are separated from the sales distribution.

| **Account**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Account A SALES |           | \$100      |
| Account B TRADE | \$15      |            |
| Account C MARK  | \$10      |            |
| Account D RECV  | \$75      |            |

### Entering Intrastat trade statistics

Use the Sales Intrastat Entry window to enter the information required to create the Intrastat Trade Report you submit to your government, and the EC Sales List, which displays cumulative goods value totals by each vendor or customer Tax Registration number. You can enter Intrastat statistics for each line item.

Intrastat is the system for collecting statistics on the trade of goods between European Union (EU) countries/regions. Intrastat data is required for all items either bought from EU vendors or sold to EU customers, and must be provided on a monthly basis. Requirements for Intrastat are similar in all EU countries/regions. The government uses these statistics as an economic indicator.

If Intrastat information was entered for the customer’s ship-to address ID, that information appears in this window. You can use the Sales Intrastat Entry window to change Intrastat information for an individual transaction, or to enter Intrastat information if none was entered for the customer.

Be sure the EU Transaction option is marked in the Sales Customer Detail Entry window. If the country code assigned to the customer’s shipping address is designated an EU country/region, this option is marked automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enter Intrastat statistics only if Intrastat tracking is enabled in the Company Setup Options window.

#### To enter Intrastat trade statistics

1. Open the Sales Transaction Entry window.
    (Sales \>\> Transactions \>\> Sales Transaction Entry)

2. Enter the EU transaction.

    When you press TAB on the Unit Price field after you enter the first line item, the Sales Intrastat Entry window opens, if you’ve chosen the EU Transaction option. You can also use the EU expansion button on the Item field to open Sales Intrastat Entry.

3. Enter Intrastat information, or change the default entries, if necessary.

4. In the Net Unit Mass field, enter the weight of the goods in kilograms.

    The item’s shipping weight from the Item Maintenance window is the default weight. You can change this information.

5. Change the line mass, if necessary.

    The line mass is the total mass per item. The line mass total is equal to the amount entered in the Unit Mass field multiplied by the amount entered in the Quantity field.

6. Enter a supplementary units amount, if applicable. The supplementary units amount is simply a second quantity. Supplementary unit amounts are required by the EU Combined Nomenclature for certain goods.

7. In the Traders Reference field, enter a reference code, such as an invoice or dispatch number, or any other information that will identify the transaction.

8. Change the goods value, if necessary. The default goods value is the extended price of the item.

9. Change the statistical value, if necessary. The default statistical value is the extended price of the item.

10. Choose OK to save the record.

## Chapter 17: Payments and deposits

Use the Sales Payment Entry window to enter information about payments or deposits received for a document.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Distributing payments separately*

- *Entering deposits and payments on orders or back orders*

- *Entering a payment for an invoice, fulfillment order, or return*

- *Posting deposits*

- *Posting payments*

- *Removing a deposit or payment*

### Distributing payments separately

If Sales Order Processing is set up to use separate payment distributions, document and payment distributions entered on the same transaction will be separated as if the document and payment were entered as separate transactions. You’ll also be able to enter multiple distributions with the same distribution type and account in the distribution entry window.

This option applies to both invoices and returns. If a quote, order, or back order with a deposit is transferred to an invoice, the deposit will have separate distributions from the invoice when this option is marked.

For example, assume that you’ve entered a sales transaction of \$100.00 with a cash payment of \$20.00. If you are using separate payment distributions, the payment will be distributed as in the following example.

| **Account**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Account A SALES |           | \$100      |
| Account B CASH  | \$20      |            |
| Account C RECV  | \$100     |            |
| Account C RECV  |           | \$20       |

If you aren’t using separate payment distributions, the distributions that are of the same type with the same account number are combined.

| **Account**     | **Debit** | **Credit** |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Account A SALES |           | \$100      |
| Account B CASH  | \$20      |            |
| Account C RECV  | \$80      |            |

### Entering deposits and payments on orders or back orders

You can enter a deposit or payment amount received from a customer for an order or back order in the Amount Received field in the Sales Transaction Entry window. Choose the Amount Received expansion button to open the Sales Payment Entry window where you can enter information about the received amount, such as the payment method.

For information about removing payments and deposits, see *Removing a deposit or payment*.

Enter a credit card payment amount if you want to charge the customer’s credit card when the order ships. If you enter a payment and a partial order is shipped, the customer will be charged only for the shipped portion of the order.

Enter a deposit if you want the amount to be available to you when the deposit is taken, regardless of when the order ships. For example, you could use a deposit for an amount received toward a layaway order.

You can split an amount received between payment and deposit types. For example, a payment can consist of a check deposit for part of the amount and a credit card payment for the remainder.

> [!NOTE]
> You can’t enter a deposit or payment amount on repeating orders.

You can’t delete or void an order or back order until all deposits on the document have been removed or transferred. Deposits and payments can be transferred with the order or back order. For more information about transferring deposits and payments, see *Chapter 27, “Transferring documents.”*

## Chapter 18: Sales Order Processing taxes

Sales tax can be calculated, modified, and distributed in Sales Order Processing. Use the Sales Tax Summary Entry window to view tax distributions and to change distribution accounts, if your system is set up to allow editing summary-level taxes. To change tax details or the amounts distributed to tax details for individual line items, use the Sales Line Item Tax Detail Entry window.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Sales tax calculations*

- *Calculating and distributing summary taxes*

- *Calculating and distributing detail taxes*

### Sales tax calculations

When you set up Sales Order Processing, you can choose to use a single tax schedule for all items on all documents or you can mark the advanced option to determine the tax for inventory items, non-inventoried items, freight, and miscellaneous charges individually. For more information on Sales Order Processing tax setup, see *Setting up taxes and options*.

Here are the components of the sales tax calculation if you selected to use an advanced tax schedule when you set up Sales Order Processing:

- **Item** The tax option for each item on the invoice is used. To view the tax option for an item, choose the Item Number expansion button to open the Sales Item Detail Entry window.

  - If the tax option for the item is Nontaxable, no tax is calculated for that item.

  - If the tax option for the item is Taxable, the tax schedule for the line item is compared to the default tax schedule from the Item Maintenance window. Taxes will be calculated for tax details found in both schedules.

  - If the tax option for the item is Base on Customers, the line item’s tax schedule is used.

- **Shipping method** The shipping method specified for the Ship To Address for each line will be used, if your system is set up to use the shipping method in tax calculations. For more information on this option, see the System Setup instructions (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System).

    To view the shipping method used for a line, expand the Sales Transaction Entry scrolling window and click the Ship To Address ID link to open the Sales Ship To Address Entry window.

    - If the shipping method is a Pickup type, the tax schedule from the Site ID on the line is used.

    - If the shipping method is a Delivery type, the tax schedule from the Ship To Address for the line is used.

        The system compares the two tax schedules—the tax schedule for the item and either the tax schedule for the ship-to address or the schedule for the site. Any details that are in common will be the tax details used to calculate the sales tax for the item.

To view the tax calculation for an item, choose the Item Number expansion button to open the Sales Item Detail Entry window. Then choose the Calculated Tax expansion button to open the Sales Line Item Tax Detail Entry window.

### Calculating and distributing summary taxes

Use the Sales Tax Summary Entry window to add, change, delete, or view summarized tax amounts for a document, as well as the accounts to which the amounts will be posted.

You can’t change the Tax amount in the Sales Transaction Entry window or the tax information in the Sales Tax Summary Entry window if your system is not set up to allow editing summary-level taxes. For more information on this setup option, see the System Setup instructions (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting Up the System).

#### To calculate and distribute summary taxes
