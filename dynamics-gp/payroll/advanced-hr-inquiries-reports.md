# Advanced Human Resources in Microsoft Dynamics GP - Inquiries and Reports

Advanced Human Resources provides both Inquiry windows and the ability to
print reports. The Inquiry windows for the most part are the history windows
for most of the components. The exception to this is the Percent Current
Inquiry, which is an inquiry allowing for various selections to be made to
narrow or broaden the scope of records shown.

## Inquiries

The Advanced Human Resources Inquiries contain the history windows for
Certification, License and Training Manager, as well as the inquiry for
Percent Current. The information on the windows can be printed from the
window. In the case of the Percent Current Inquiry, both the information on
the screen and a Percent Current Totals report can be printed using the
printer icon on the window.

### Certification History

Use the Certification History window to view all the activity for a specific

Employee/Certification record. The history record is written as the latest
History record when changes are saved on the Certification Entry window.

To open the Certification History window, click the **HR and Payroll**
series button, click **Human Resources** on the Inquiry content pane and
then click **Certification History**.

Enter or select an **Employee ID**. The **Department** and **Position**
fields displays from the Employee Maintenance window.

Enter or select a **Certification Code** for current Employee.

The **Inactive** checkbox will inactivate the current Certification History.

**License History**.

1. Enter or select an **Employee ID**. The **Department** and **Position** fields displays from the Employee Maintenance window.

2. Enter or select a **License Number** for the current Employee.

The **Inactive** checkbox will inactivate the current License History.

### Training History

Use the Training History window to view all the transactions by Course/Class
ID for a specific employee. The history record is written as the latest
History record when changes are saved on the Employee Training window.

### Employee Certifications, Licenses and Training

### Health and Wellness History

Use the Health and Wellness History window to see all the activity that has
occurred for a specific Employee / Code record. The system tracks all
changes to each existing record. To open this window, click the **HR and
Payroll** series button, click **Human Resources** on the Inquiry content
pane and then click **Health and Wellness History**.

Enter an **Employee ID**. Enter or select a **Code**. The **Description**
and **Category** displays from the Health and Wellness Code Setup window.

The scrolling window allows you to view all History information related to
the Employee and the Health and Wellness Code selected.

## Reports

The Advanced Human Resources module provides printing capabilities by using
the printer icons on the individual windows. For example, pulling up the
Category Setup window and selecting the printer icon (without making any
Category selections) a report will print giving all of the Category Codes
currently set up.

The other way to access information stored in Advanced Human Resources is by
using SmartList Builder. Using this module, the user can build SmartLists
with the data required to meet their reporting needs as it relates to
Advanced Human Resources.

### Excel-based Reports

Certification, License and Training Manager allows the user to track
certifications, licenses, training and other data for employees using back
office functionality. The user can also view and report on this data via
reports. It is necessary, however, for managers and other company officials,
who may not be users of the Microsoft Dynamics GP system, to have access to
this data for decision making purposes. These individuals can use Microsoft
Office Excel reporting to meet their unique needs for viewing and sorting
certification, license and training data and for customizing the
presentation of data to satisfy their requirements.

Excel-based reporting is available for the following existing
reports/inquiries.

- Certification List Report

- License List Report

- Training List Report

- Certification History Report

- License History Report

- Training History Report

The **Required Certification / License / Training report** can be used to measure actual versus requirements for all positions within a department/position.

### SmartList Builder

If the Microsoft Dynamics GP SmartList Builder module is installed, all of
the Certification, License and Training Manager and Employee Health and
Wellness Manager fields will be available to create SmartList Queries.

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the SmartList Builder documentation for instructions on using SmartList Builder.

## Summary

Advanced Human Resources provides inquiry and reporting capabilities by
using History windows, the Percent Current Inquiry and the use of printer
icons on individual windows. SmartList Builder also enhances the reporting
capabilities.

    Inquiry.
