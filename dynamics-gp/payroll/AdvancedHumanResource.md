# Advanced Human Resources in Microsoft Dynamics GP

Dynamics GP Advanced Human Resources includes three components:

- Benefit Lifecycle Manager

  This module integrates with the Microsoft Dynamics GP Payroll module. It is designed to create Human Resources, Payroll Benefit
and Payroll Deduction setup records that are not immediately effective. At the appropriate time, the records can be activated and previous setup
records are tracked in history.
- Certification, License, and Training Manager

  This module integrates with the Microsoft Dynamics GP Human Resources module. Certification, License and Training Manager creates the link between the skills, training and
certifications as well as provides a means to track employee certifications, licensing and training. It also enables the tracking of certifications or license to the extent of reporting on expiration, renewal periods and whether the certifications or licenses are required. You may query on required certifications, licenses, training and dates of expiration. In addition, a query can be created on a specific list of employees with a particular certification, license or training.
- Employee Health and Wellness

  This module integrates with the Microsoft Dynamics GP Human Resources module. The purpose of the Employee Health and Wellness Manager is to provide features for tracking all immunizations, vaccinations and tests required for each employee. The results for each test can also be recorded. Since codes can be defined to meet the company needs,
this solution allows for additions or changes as business or job requirements change. The Employee Health and Wellness Manager will enable the user to schedule follow-up vaccinations, immunizations and tests. Having all the data available will enable easy searches on who is past due or scheduled for a particular immunization, vaccination or test. The requirements per employee are more easily assigned and tracked by the utilization of health and wellness templates.

## Benefit Lifecycle Manager

Benefit Lifecycle Manager is used to create Human Resources Benefit, Payroll
Benefit and Payroll Deduction setup records that are not immediately
effective when creating employee level records or running payroll in
Microsoft Dynamics GP. Benefit Lifecycle Manager then enables the user to
activate the Future Effective setup records at the appropriate time, while
tracking the past setup records in history.

By creating a Future Effective date to the record, this information can also
be extended to the Benefit Self Service product on.

Benefit Lifecycle Manager integrates with the Microsoft Dynamics GP Payroll
module. When creating Human Resources Benefit, Payroll Benefit or Payroll
Deduction records, the user can easily create or modify the Future Effective
record as well.

### Features in Benefit Lifecycle Manager

The features and capabilities of Benefit Lifecycle Manager include:

- Create Human Resources Setup Future Effective records for:

  - Miscellaneous Benefit o Health Insurance o Life Insurance o Retirement
        Plans

- Make Pending Changes available to Benefit Self Service for informational and
    enrollment purposes.

### Release Requirements for Benefit Lifecycle Manager

Certain features and the use of this product must meet the following setup requirements to ensure proper functionality. Failure to use the Benefit Lifecycle Manager product as specified here will not currently be supported.

    Payroll. There is **NO** reconciling functionality for future effective
    records.

### Multi-User Access

Additional checks have been added to restrict access to Benefit Codes and
Future Effective Benefit Codes when Benefit Lifecycle Manager is being used
to ensure that benefit codes are modified correctly. The restrictions added
include the following scenarios and if one of these scenarios is
encountered, the system prompts with "This code is open by another user.
Please try again later."

Access denied scenarios:

- If the benefit code is opened in the Future Effective mode in the Human Resources Benefit Setup, Payroll Benefit Setup or Payroll Deduction Setup window, no other employee is able to open that benefit code in any of the three areas at the core setup level.

- If more than one employee currently has the benefit code open in the Human Resources Benefit Setup, Payroll Benefit Setup or Payroll Deduction Setup
    window and there is an attempt to create a new or display the existing Future Effective record in any of the three areas for that benefit code.

When the Human Resources to Payroll Integration is happening for a Future Effective record, if another employee would open that benefit code in one of the subsequent windows before the Human Resources to Payroll Integration gets to that level, when the Human Resources to Payroll Integration hits that level, the integration is stopped.
