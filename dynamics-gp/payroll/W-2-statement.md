# W-2 Wage and tax statement data source guide

All W-2 information comes from the Year-end Wage File. This document describes each box on the W-2 statement and explains where information in the Year-end Wage File comes from within your back-office application. Refer to this information if you have questions about the amounts appearing on your Year-end
Employee Wage Report or your W-2 statements. We recommend that you print the Year-end Wage Report to verify the information before you print the W-2 statements.
