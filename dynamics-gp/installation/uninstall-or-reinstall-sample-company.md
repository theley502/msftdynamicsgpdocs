## Uninstall the Sample Company

3. Choose the lookup button, double-click **Fabrikam, Inc.**, and then choose **Delete**.

For the steps to install the Support Administrator Console, choose the following article number to view the article How to install the Support Administrator Console utility in Microsoft Dynamics GP in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
[870052.](http://vkbexternal/VKBWebService/ViewContent.aspx?scid=kb%3bEN-US%3b870052&PortalId=1)

If the option to **Add sample company data** is not available, refer to the following list:

- The account framework may be too small to allow for the addition of a sample company. The minimum account framework required is 3-4-2 for the sample company. To verify the account framework, run the following script against the DYNAMICS database in Query Analyzer, in SQL Server Management Studio, or in the Support Administrator Console.

    ```sql
    SELECT SGMTNAME, SGMNTLTH FROM DYNAMICS..SY00302

- The SQL folder may not exist in the Microsoft Dynamics GP installation folder on this computer.

  - If you are using Microsoft Dynamics GP or an earlier version, reinstall Microsoft Dynamics GP by using the Server option.
  - If you are using Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, look for the Add sample company data option in Utilities on the server installation, or copy the SQL folder from the installation CD. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. In the Great Plains installation folder, create a new folder that is named *SQL*. By default, the Great Plains installation folder is located at C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Business Solutions\\Great Plains.

    2. Choose the *SQL* folder, and then choose the *7.0* folder on CD1 for Great Plains.

    3. Copy the following folders to the new SQL folder that you created in step 1:

        - Company
        - HR
        - Lesson
        - System
        - Upgrade
        - Util
        - Right-choose the SQL folder, select Properties, and then make sure that Read Only is not selected.
