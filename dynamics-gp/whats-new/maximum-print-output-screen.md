# Maximum Print Output Screen

With the October 2020 release of Dynamics GP, you are getting the largest requested feature of all time, maximized print output when printing to screen. This was a huge request by our customers over the last few years and we have finally put this into the core product.

How many times in a day do you print a report to screen and now by habit you are always going to the top right to expand the report to FULL SCREEN? With 18.3, no longer, with a blink of your eye, the report will automatically pop out to full screen mode for you.

Improve customer print experience. User no longer must manually maximum the print output screen each time they print to screen.
