# Copy/Paste Purchasing transactions from Excel

We all know how much our users like the Copy and Paste functionality in General Ledger, why not add it in other areas? The new feature enables users to define purchase transactions, along with distributions, and import them into the **Payables Transaction Entry** window in Dynamics GP. This will improve efficiency, reduce rekeying errors, and enhancement user experience.

With this feature, you can choose to do distributions or not, similar to our General Ledger copy paste.

Use the **Transaction Entry'' window to copy/paste PM Transactions and PM Distributions.

The Excel spreadsheet must have the required fields in this order to copy paste correctly; not all amount fields need to have an amount. You must copy/paste all data fields only; do not include the header fields.

- Vendor

- Purchases

- Trade Discount

- Freight

- Misc.

- Document Number

- P.O. Number

- Cash - if the cash field has an amount, the **Payables Cash Entry** window will automatically open after clicking the "Paste" button.

In the **Payables Transactions** window. found under **Purchasing**, click **Transactions**, and choose **Transaction Entry**. Choose the **Vendor ID** and put your cursor in the **Purchasing** field and then choose the **Paste** button in the tool bar.

> [!TIP]
> This feature will also work in Web Client.

> [!TIP]
> Just like when you copy/paste in the General Ledger, if you choose the **Intercompany** field, the **Paste** button becomes unavailable.

Distributions will default from the Vendor record unless you paste in distributions. It is not required to do distributions.

In the **Payables Transactions** window, found under **Purchasing**, click **Transactions**, and choose **Transaction Entry**. Choose the **Vendor ID**, click **Distributions**, copy lines from Excel, choose the **Paste** button from the menu which will populate the information. Close the **Distribution** window, if you are prompted with a warning you can choose OK.

Now paste the rest of the payable's transaction once the distributions are copied.
