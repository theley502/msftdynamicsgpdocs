# 1099 MISC Form Updates

Reaction to IRS changes. Non-employee compensation has been moved to its own form as stated above and other values are moving to different boxes on the 1099 MISC form.

The 1099-MISC form has been revised to meet the IRS regulatory changes for the 2020 tax year. In the Vendor Card point to Options, point to 1099 Box, click the drop-down menu.

- Box 9: Crop insurance proceeds are reported in.

- Box 10: Gross proceeds to an attorney are reported in.

- Box 12: Section 409A deferrals are reported.

- Box 14: Nonqualified deferred compensation income is reported.

- Boxes 15, and 17 report state taxes withheld, and amount of income earned in the state, respectively.

- Box 7 was moved to the 1099 NEC form as a checkbox Payer made Direct Sales of $5,000 or more, etc.

- Box 16 the state number is not a currency field and it is available at the header level of the 1099 details window. Hence the data entered in the header will be shown in the form.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature will be rolled back to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2016 in the 2020 Year-end update.
