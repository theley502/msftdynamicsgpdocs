# Multi-Factor Authentication

Starting with the Dynamics GP October 2020 release, you will have the ability to use Multi-Factor Authentication for e-mail functionality. This new feature relies on an Azure Active Director App Registration. In this first section we will go over how to perform the Azure side the of the configuration.

## Register the app

1. First, you'll need to have an administrator who can log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. In the search box, type *App Registration* and select that option:

4. You will then choose settings for your new application.
    a. Enter a display name for the application (e.g. GPMFAApp)
    b. For **Supported account types** select the second option (**Account in any organizational directory (Any azure AD account – Multitenant)**) for most all configurations.             Choosing the wrong option can lead to an Unknown Error when using MFA in Dynamics GP.
