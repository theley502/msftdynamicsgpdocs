# Microsoft Dynamics GP Receivables Management Part 4: Inquiries and reports

You can use inquiries and reports to analyze the information you’ve entered into the system. You can analyze customer activity and transaction information and display the information either on the computer screen or on a report. This information includes the following topics:

- *Chapter 24, “Customer inquiries,”* explains how to view detailed or summarized information about your customers.

- *Chapter 25, “Transaction inquiries,”* explains how to view detailed, summarized, or multicurrency information about transactions you’ve entered.

- *Chapter 26, “Reports,”* describes how to use reports to analyze receivables activity and identify errors in transaction entry.<!--- MISSING CONTENT-->

## Chapter 24: Customer inquiries

You can use the Receivables Management inquiry windows to view detailed or summarized information about your customers.

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Multicurrency inquiries*

- *Reporting currency*

- *Viewing customer information*

- *Viewing customer transaction information*

- *Viewing customer period activity*

- *Viewing customer yearly activity*

- *Viewing customer payment information*

- *Viewing national account details*

#### Multicurrency inquiries

You can view multicurrency amounts in the originating, functional, or reporting currency. Choose View \>\> Currency \>\> Functional, Originating, or Reporting while viewing a Receivables inquiry window. This option is saved on a per user, per window basis.

You also can use the currency list button in the windows that support changing the currency view. The View menu and currency list button are available in the following windows:

- Receivables Transaction Inquiry – Customer

- Receivables Transaction Inquiry – Document

- Receivables Transaction Inquiry Zoom

- Cash Receipts Inquiry Zoom

The first time you open these windows after registering Multicurrency Management, all the transactions are displayed in their originating currencies. If you change the currency view, the option you last used is the default view the next time you open that window.

#### Reporting currency

A reporting currency is used to convert functional or originating currency amounts to another currency on inquiries and reports. For example, if the US dollar is the functional currency for your company, you can set up the euro as your reporting currency to view an inquiry window with currency amounts displayed in the euro currency.

During the reporting currency setup in Multicurrency Management, you must set up a reporting currency, and enter a default exchange rate and rate calculation method. Depending on how your system is set up, you might be able to override the default reporting currency exchange rate or rate calculation method on inquiries and reports.

To change the default reporting currency exchange rate, choose View \>\> Currency \>\> Modify Reporting Rate while using Receivables inquiry windows to open the Modify Reporting Rate window.

See the Multicurrency Management documentation for more information about the reporting currency.

#### Viewing customer information

Use the Customer Inquiry window to view address, shipping, tax, and other sales information you entered for a customer card using the Customer Maintenance window.

**To view a customer’s information:**

If the customer record has document attachments, choose the Attachment Management icon to open the Document Attachment Inquiry window.

This window also displays any voided or waived transactions. You can view posted, unposted, and historical information separately.

**Amounts Since Last Close** Displays the selected customer’s current summary amounts.

The information that is displayed in the Customer Yearly Summary Inquiry window when you select Amounts Since Last Close in the Summary View list might not represent actual fiscal year totals if you close the fiscal year before or after the last day of the fiscal year. For example, the amounts in the Year to Date column might continue to increase as transactions are posted after the last day of the fiscal year; then when you close the fiscal year, the amounts in the Last Year column will include those transactions posted after the last day of the fiscal year that you closed.

**Fiscal Year** Displays the selected customer’s summary amounts for the fiscal year you enter.

**Calendar Year** Displays the selected customer’s summary amounts for the calendar year you enter.

Closing the fiscal year will not affect the information that is displayed in the Customer Yearly Summary Inquiry window when you select Fiscal Year or Calendar Year in the Summary View list. The amounts displayed for those selections are dependent on the year and periods you enter to display.

**To view a customer’s yearly activity:**

1. Open the Customer Yearly Summary Inquiry window. 
(Sales \>\> Inquiry \>\> Yearly Summary)

2. Enter or select a customer ID.
