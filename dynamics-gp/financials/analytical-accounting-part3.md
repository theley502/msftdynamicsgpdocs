# Microsoft Dynamics GP Analytical Accounting Part 3: Routines, Inquiries and Reports

You can make queries and generate reports within Analytical Accounting that
will help you analyze your company’s chart of accounts in detail. Use the
Analytical Accounting query wizard windows to create and run queries that
are based on your analysis requirements.

You can also compare the allocated amounts with the actual figures to
analyze how the budgeted amounts are being used. The Multilevel Query wizard
allows you to generate reports on the budgets.

The following information is discussed:

- *Chapter 16, “Year-end close for Analytical Accounting”*explains how
    analytical information is transferred to history and how balances are
    consolidated and brought forward during the year-end close process.

- *Chapter 17, “Inquiries”*explains how to create, modify, and print
    Analytical Accounting queries.

- *Chapter 18, “Reports”*shows you how to use Analytical Accounting reports to
    view your analysis information.

## Chapter 16: Year-end close for Analytical Accounting

This information is divided into the following sections:

- *Including Analytical Accounting in the year-end close process*

- *Closing a year with analysis information*

- *Consolidating analysis information and carrying balances forward*

- *Transferring analysis information for closed years to history*

### Including Analytical Accounting in the year-end close process

If you’ve included Analytical Accounting in the year-end close process,
closing the year transfers the current year analytical data for each account
to account and transaction history (if you’re keeping history records).
Analytical data for alphanumeric transaction dimensions is consolidated and
the balance is carried forward to the next year.

To include Analytical Accounting information in the year-end closing
process, you must:

- Mark the Include in Year End Close option in the Analytical Accounting
    Options window. Refer to *Setting up Analytical Accounting options*. Mark
    the Include in Year End Close checkbox in the Transaction Dimension
    Maintenance window for the alphanumeric transaction dimensions that you want
    to consolidate balances for in the year-end close process. Refer to
    *Defining transaction dimensions*. Balances are brought forward only for the
    selected transaction dimensions.

- If you have previously closed years in Microsoft Dynamics GP, transfer the
    analytical data for those years to history and carry forward the
    consolidated balances before you close the current year. Not doing so will
    lead to incorrect brought forward balances. Refer to *Transferring analysis
    information for closed years to history*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not post adjustments to a closed year after you have marked to include
analysis data in the year-end close process, and before you have run the
Transfer transaction Data to History utility. Doing so will result in
incorrect brought forward balances.

### Closing a year with analysis information

When you close a year with analytical information, the year-end closing
process:

- Transfers all current year analytical data for each account to account and
    transaction history (if you’re keeping history records). The analytical data
    is transferred to history for all transaction dimensions, whether or not
    you’ve marked to consolidate them during the year-end close.

- Consolidates analytical information related to the marked alphanumeric
    transaction dimensions for open year profit and loss accounts and transfers
    it to the Retained Earnings account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Balance brought forward transactions are created for the retained earnings account even if no profit and loss distributions exist in the fiscal year that the year-end close is being run for. This ensures that your analytical data is accurate if you have directly entered the net value to the retained earnings account as part of a single balanced beginning balance transaction when installing Microsoft Dynamics GP.

- Consolidates analytical information related to the marked alphanumeric
    transaction dimensions for balance sheet accounts, bringing the balances
    forward as the accounts’ beginning balances in the new fiscal year.

    Refer to *Consolidating analysis information and carrying balances forward* for more information.

- Zeroes the analytical balance for all profit and loss accounts after they’ve
    been closed to the Retained Earnings account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enter adjustments to a profit and loss account after closing a year, the analytical information for the adjustment is automatically updated to the corresponding retained earnings account. You won’t need to do anything following the adjustments.*

- Brings the balances of unit account forward to the new fiscal year.

- Prints the Analytical Accounting Year-End Closing Report.

Refer to the Microsoft Dynamics GP documentation for more information on the
year-end closing process.

### Consolidating analysis information and carrying balances forward

When you run the year-end close process, the analytical data for
alphanumeric transaction dimensions is consolidated and carried forward to
the next year. The consolidation is performed only for those transaction
dimensions that you’ve marked to include in the year-end process. Refer to
*Including Analytical Accounting in the year-end close process*.

In the balance brought forward journal:

- One assignment is created for each unique combination of account,
    alphanumeric transaction dimensions, and codes in the case of balance sheet
    accounts.

- One assignment is created for each unique combination of alphanumeric
    transaction dimensions and codes across all profit and loss accounts.

- If amounts without any analytical information exist, then a single
    assignment is created for the total unassigned amount with no alphanumeric
    transaction dimension codes assigned to it.

- The total of all assignments for a balance sheet account represents the
    General Ledger distribution amount or the brought forward balance for the
    account.

- The total of all assignments for the profit and loss accounts is carried
forward to the Retained Earnings account.

#### Example

Account 1011 which is a balance sheet account for customer A is assigned to
an accounting class. The following alphanumeric transaction dimensions and
codes are created with a valid relationship to one another.

| **Dimensions** | **Codes**  |
|----------------|------------|
| Project        | PRJ1, PRJ2 |
| Product        | PDT1, PDT2 |
| Location       | LOC1, LOC2 |

**Scenario 1**

Partial assignments are not allowed. Transaction dimension codes are
optional and the following transactions are posted for the account 1011
during the year.

| **Dr.** | **Cr.** | **Location Code** | **Product Code** | **Project Code** |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 250000  | \-    | LOC 1             | PDT 1            | PRJ 1            |

On performing the year-end close, one assignment is created with the
consolidated amount for each unique combination of transaction dimension
codes.

| **Journal**                  | **Account**            | **Dr.** | **Cr.** |
|-------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Journal Entry** | **Account 1011**       | 490000  | \-    |

| Assignment 3      | \--- - --- - ---    | 177500  |         |

### Transferring analysis information for closed years to history

If you have previously closed years in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you must
transfer the analytical data for those years to history before you close the
current year. You also can consolidate and bring forward the closing balance
as the next year’s opening balance. This also will transfer the balances for
any adjustments you posted to a closed year. You must run this process
sequentially starting from the first closed year up to the most recently
closed year.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must perform this process before you close an open year or post an
adjustment to a closed year. Not doing so will result in incorrect balances
being brought forward.

**To transfer analysis information for closed years to history:**

1. Open the Transfer Transaction Data to History window. 
    (Administration \>\> Utilities \>\> Financial \>\> Analytical Accounting
    \>\> Move Data to History)

2. The Year field displays the earliest closed year for the company in
    Microsoft Dynamics GP.

3. Select an action to perform.

    **Transfer transaction detail to history** Select this option to transfer all the analysis information for the selected closed year to history.

    **Consolidate transactions and transfer detail to history** Select this option to consolidate transactions in the closed year based on the combination of alphanumeric transaction dimensions that are marked to include in the yearend close process. The analysis information for the selected year is moved to history and the closing balances are brought forward to the next year. Refer to *Consolidating analysis information and carrying balances forward*.

    **Print transfer preview report only** Select this option to print a preview report before performing the transfer and consolidation.

1. Choose OK to process the selected option.

2. Choose Cancel to cancel the process and close the window.

## Chapter 17: Inquiries

The inquiries available in Analytical Accounting Inquiry allow you to view
transaction dimension relationships and budgeted vs. actual figures. You can
create distribution queries to view analysis codes for every assignment, and
create multilevel queries to view analysis code information in the form of
trees and levels. You can define queries and save them or print the queries
without saving. The queries export data to an Excel worksheet.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be using Excel 2000 or higher to export Analytical Accounting queries to Excel.

Before you start generating a query, be sure that the functional currency
you’re using has a negative sign before the amount. You can select this
option in the Currency Setup window (Administration \>\> Setup \>\> System
\>\> Currency).

The query output to Excel must be limited to 256 columns.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot run more than one query at a time on the same system.

Ledger, whether or not the transaction accounts are linked to an account
class. For transactions that are not linked to an account class, a single
assignment will be displayed, without any analysis information.

### Creating and running a multilevel query

You can use Analytical Accounting to generate multilevel queries based on
your specific requirements and transaction dimensions. You also can create
queries based on columns that you choose to display in the query. The
analysis information that is generated when you create a query, is exported
to Excel. You can generate a query to view budgeted and actual information
for budget IDs, and view the variance and variance percentage between
budgeted and actual figures. You can view the posted analysis information
for transaction dimension codes that you subsequently set to inactive
status.

You can create reports with as many levels or rows as you require. A level
may be accounts, a dimension, a transaction, a customer, a vendor, an item
or site, a tree within a dimension, or a time-period: for example, a week, a
month, a fiscal period, or a half-year. You also can create a report for a
tree, which will display all the levels of the tree.

The level of a report can include some or all codes, accounts, or nodes
within a tree. You can create and save your report options or print the
report without saving it. Rows with zero values can be hidden at any level
within the report. You also can include transactions for which no code has
been entered in a report. This is useful for tracking errors.

You can view or hide sub-totals at each level. Also, you can select to
display details, and also whether to display the detail at the same level
throughout the report, or within sections.

Queries also can be based on time periods: for example you can select
Year-to-Date, This Period, Last Period including Last Year data and also
comparisons between this year and last year.

**To create and run a multilevel query:**

1. Open the Multilevel Query wizard-Welcome window. 
    (Inquiry \>\> Financial \>\> Analytical Accounting \>\> Multilevel Query)

2. Select the type of query to run from the following options:

also can change existing query definitions and save these changes. Saved
Query definitions can be used again later.

Choose Next to open the Multilevel Query wizard-Query Maintenance window,
where you can define the query.

### Including brought forward balances in a multilevel query

You must select the appropriate options in order to view brought forward
balances in a multilevel query. The balances are consolidated based on the
