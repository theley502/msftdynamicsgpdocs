# Payment Document Management 

Payment Document Management allows you to enter sales and purchasing transactions using payment methods other than cash, check or credit card. You can submit these documents for risk assessment, discounting and collection to your bank or similar entity.

Payment Document Management uses the information in the Payables Management and Receivables Management modules, and updates the General Ledger and Bank Reconciliation modules.

This introduction is divided into the following sections:

-   *What’s in this manual*

-   *Symbols and conventions*

-   *Resources available from the Help menu*

-   *Send us your documentation comments*

## Chapter 1: Overview

Payment Document Management allows you to make and receive payments using special payment documents. Use this information to enable Payment Document Management and to understand how it works.

When you set up Payment Document Management, you can open each setup window and enter information, or you can use the Setup Checklist window (Administration \>\> Setup \>\> Setup Checklist) to guide you through the setup process. See your System Setup Guide (Help \>\> Contents \>\> select Setting up the System) for more information about the Setup Checklist window.

This information is divided into the following sections:

-   *Understanding Payment Document Management*

-   *Enabling Payment Document Management*

### Understanding Payment Document Management

Certain European and Latin American countries/regions deal in payment documents such as bills of exchange or promissory notes, apart from making payments by cash, check and credit cards. Payment Document Management allows users to enter receipts and payments using such payment methods. Payment documents that do not have a due date specified can be settled at any time. However, the documents that have specific due dates can only be settled after the due date. To receive the payment for such documents before the due date, the creditor must submit these documents to a bank or similar entity for collection. The bank then performs a risk assessment to assign a risk level to the debtors. Based on this assessment, the bank decides which documents it will accept. The creditor is then paid the document amount after deducting the commission or discount amount. The bank submits these documents to the debtor on the due date and collects the settlement.

### Enabling Payment Document Management

You must enable payment documents before you can start using them in purchasing and sales transactions.

**To enable Payment Document Management:**

1.  Open the Company Payment Document Management Setup window. (Administration \>\> Setup \>\> Company \>\> Payment Document Setup)

![Screenshot of the Company Payment Document Management Setup window.](media/SPDMS.jpg)

### Setting up default accounts for sales

The Sales Payment Document Management Setup window allows you to set up default accounts in the Ledger posting of payment documents, as well as the General Ledger Entry Level used in the payment document remittance process.

**To set up default accounts for sales:**

1.  Open the Sales Payment Document Management Setup window. (Administration \>\> Setup \>\> Sales \>\> Payment Document Setup)

2.  Transactions with payment documents require specific accounting entries. There may be one entry per payment document, or, alternatively, one entry for a whole remittance consisting of several payment documents. You can choose to set up each of the payment document operations (risk assessment, discount, collection, or settlement) in either way.

3.  Risk assessment, discount, and collection are normally posted in one entry per document (to improve transaction monitoring) and per settlement process, in a single summary entry of all the documents, where a single amount appears on bank statements for total cheques transacted.

4.  Enter or select the accounts for the following fields:

![Screenshot of the Sales Payment Document Management Setup window.](media/SPDMS.jpg)

**Receive** For cheques received.
**Risk Assessment** For risk assessing cheques.
**Discount** For discounted cheques.
**Collect** For collecting cheques.
**NSF** For bounced cheques.
**Settle** For settled cheques.

This payment document setup level is required, as these accounts make sure that all transactions entered are properly configured. If accounts are established at this higher level, there are no restrictions on the accounts to be used when preparing a remittance.

Choose Save to save the changes and close the window.

For this purpose, the system incorporates various fields of different types and formats (text, date, amount and bank account number 0000-0000-00-0000000000) for entering text that will later appear linked to this payment document to allow users to complete this information. Each of these fields can be selected as Required, in order to specify whether it is compulsory for the user to complete this information. The purpose of these fields is to store information on the system in order to establish search conditions or in the future to have data on the system that can be used with other tools (e.g. printing devices).

5.  Mark the Discountable option if you want the payment document to be discounted.

6.  Mark whether the document can be presented as discountable or not.

The Deferred Discount option will be available if you select the Discountable option.

7.  Mark the Collected option if you want the document to be collected.

9.  Choose Save to save the values entered in this window.

### Setting up a chequebook for payment documents

The Sales Chequebook Payment Document Setup window allows you to establish a more specific set up level by selecting the options that will be taken into account when using the chequebook with a specific payment document.

**To set up a chequebook for payment documents:**

1.  Open the Sales Chequebook Payment Document Setup window. (Cards \>\>
    Financial \>\> Chequebook \>\> Additional \>\> Sales Pmnt. Doc. Setup)

![Screenshot of the Sales Chequebook Payment Document Setup window.](media/SPDMS.jpg)

If a value is entered in the previous field (e.g. 020000001), unmarking this field will prevent users from modifying the number generated by the system.

6.  If you want to identify chequebooks with document statuses, e.g. received bills of exchange and discounted bills of exchange, for each operation that is performed in this chequebook, the Destination chequebook can be set to pass the bill once the indicated operation has been performed.

7.  Enter or select the account to be used in each transaction to customize this account for the specific payment document and chequebook. If this information is not entered, the default accounts indicated in the module set up will be used when a properly configured transaction is performed.

*In order to prevent the account entry generated on the remittance from using the default accounts, the accounts must be customized for every chequebook.*

8.  Enter the Max Payment Doc. Amount. This allows you to establish a maximum collectable amount for the specific payment document by setting a limit for the acceptance of risk.

9.  Enter a password if a maximum amount has been assigned in the previous field, as no collections exceeding this amount will be accepted. You need to enter this password to continue with an operation even though the maximum value has been exceeded.

10.  Choose Save to save the entries made in this window.

### Assigning a default payment document

Use the Debtor Payment Document Maintenance window to assign a default payment document to each debtor.

**To assign a default payment document:**

2.  Enter or select the debtor ID.

3.  Enter a payment document name which will be used when printing payment documents (receipts, bills, etc.), if you want to display the debtor name in a different way.

4.  Choose Setup to open the Debtor Payment Document Setup window. You can view the setup of the payment document for the selected debtor. This set up level is not compulsory (if it is not defined, the system default set up in Sales will be used).

You can set the debtor default payment document and the other payment documents that the debtor may use in this window. For this reason, and by default, when this window is opened the Payment Doc. ID field is blank since you may want to set up another payment document for the debtor.

-   Enter a Payment Doc. Name which will be used when printing payment documents (receipts, bills, etc.) to display the debtor name in a different way.

-   Select whether to take the chequebook ID from Payment Document or Debtor. This allows you to set the chequebook that is used by default in debtor collections performed with this payment document. This is taken according to the chequebook set up in the payment document. If it is taken from the actual debtor, select the Debtor option and enter the Chequebook ID, which corresponds to the chequebook that you want to use in collections from debtors with this type of payment document.

-   Select whether to take the Payment Doc. Account from the Chequebook or Debtor. This allows you to determine whether the accounts that will be used to perform transactions with this payment document are those that have been set in the chequebook associated with the payment document, or whether you want to modify them for this specific debtor in this payment document. If special accounts were not set in the chequebook the default accounts indicated in the sales module set up will be used.

-   Select whether to take the Max. Payment Doc. Amount from the Chequebook or the Debtor. This allows you to determine the origin of the maximum amount that will be accepted in a debtor payment collection. For example, in the case of a high-risk debtor, only a given account for collection on paper is admitted; if this maximum is exceeded, only cash payments would be accepted from the debtor.

-   Enter a password if a maximum amount has been assigned in the previous field, as no collections exceeding this amount will be accepted. You need to enter this password to continue with an operation even though the maximum value has been exceeded.

-   Choose Save to save the changes.
